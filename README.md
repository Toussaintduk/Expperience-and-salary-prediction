# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **AFRETEC Training Program on Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**.  
The objective of the project is to apply **Linear Regression** to predict an individual’s **salary based on years of work experience**.

Linear regression is one of the fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms, and this project demonstrates its practical application in real-world data analysis and prediction.
