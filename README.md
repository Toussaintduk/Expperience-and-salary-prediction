# Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

##  Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **AFRETEC Training Program on Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**.  
The objective of the project is to apply **Linear Regression** to predict an individual’s **salary based on years of work experience**.

Linear regression is one of the fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms, and this project demonstrates its practical application in real-world data analysis and prediction.

##  Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of **supervised learning**
- Implement **linear regression** from data preprocessing to prediction
- Analyze the relationship between **experience** and **salary**
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate **metrics**
- Gain hands-on experience in **machine learning workflows**

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains two main features:
- **Years of Experience** (Independent Variable)
- **Salary** (Dependent Variable)

The data is assumed to be clean and suitable for demonstrating linear regression concepts.
